## preparation ##


  process_title1: Initial project discussion
  process_content1: A successful house project starts with a good brief and a vision. This first discussion either made in person or through a video call is essential to understand the project in all its aspects as well as the expectations from its owners. Communication is key from the earliest possible stage in order to achieve your dream home.

  process_title2: Document compilation
  process_content2: In order to consider the project as a whole, it is also important to gather all the information (photos, cadastral plans, copy of local planning regulations, design inspirations, etc.). This, to identify the missing pieces of information that will be needed to progress.

  process_title3: Survey
  process_content3: Either for a new build, a renovation project or even for an extension, a site survey is mandatory in order to assess the existing and evaluate the future scope of work. It must consider all aspects of the plot property (dimensions, condition, etc.).

  process_title4: Gross estimate
  process_content4: Unless money is no matter, the reliable gross estimate will allow you to have a clearer understanding of the scope of work and the financial implications that go with it. This often enables the owners of a project to re-evaluate the project and the parts in which they wish to invest money or not. As a result, many are also able to plan their finances in order to have the necessary liquidity for the build phase.

  process_title5: Project feasibility assessment
  process_content5: This is where the sensible evaluation of the project characteristics takes place assessing the results of the survey and the gross estimate. Other important factors are taken into account including the local authorities recommendation for planning approval as well as the desired timeline for the project to be completed. When all boxes are ticked it is time to move onto the design phase.

  process_title7: Design contract
  process_content7: Designing your dream home in detail is not a simple task and every effort must be applied to turn your ideas into plans. This very essential phase of your project is included in one simple contract covering all necessary architectural plans and technical studies until planning permission has been obtained. This will bring you peace of mind until the build phase.

  process_title8: Specifications listing
  process_content8: In order to ensure that your house will include all the necessary space, equipment and features to accommodate your taste and needs, the design of your house must start by a detailed listing of all specifications. A document lists it all and is ready for you to complete either on your own and with the help of our team so that nothing is missed.

  process_title9: Draft layout plans
  process_content9: As a house is first of all a combination of spaces, the draft layout plans is the puzzle game where the different options are identified. The excitement rises as decisions are being made. Most uncertainties disappear as you can start to imagine the logical link between all rooms.

  process_title10: Sketch of concept building
  process_content10: Although it is very tempting to start drawing prior to this stage and sometimes beneficial to get inspirations, this is the stage where the magic starts to take place and the house internal but also external shapes are designed. The look is therefore more concrete and changes can also be applied in order to achieve the desired style.

  process_title11: Planning pre-approval
  process_content11: Planning can be complicated when the project is not developed in accordance to the local regulations. This is why they must be considered from the preparation phase. Whilst the house has been designed in consideration with the planning rules, submission of the concept building for pre-approval is a must. It allows the process to progress efficiently to the architectural drawings with the peace of mind resulting from the positive feedback of local authorities. If any changes are required, it is the best time to do this so that no time is wasted and no additional delays are occurred.

  process_title12: 3D modelling
  process_content12: Drawings are essential to the design phase but the most up-to-date technology can now allow you to get a very realistic impression of your house. An accurate 3D model of your house at scale is therefore created for you to have a very clear idea of what it is going to look like and which materials would go well together. It’s like being in a video game of your own house and even the trades like to see it during the build phase to complete the work in perfect accordance to the model.

  process_title13: Architectural plans
  process_content13: Once the proposed project has received a satisfactory feedback from the planning authorities and all details have been decided on the 3D, the architectural plans can now be drawn up. This includes the master plan, the layouts, the elevations and the sections, at scale and with all the necessary dimensions and details.

  process_title14: Technical studies
  process_content14: In order to apply for planning permission, a few mandatory technical studies must be carried out starting with the soil study. A soil engineer will collect samples on site in specific locations on the plot. The soil resistance and its permeability are two major components that will be highlighted in his report. This will allow for the waste water treatment study to be carried out and for the mandatory certificate to be delivered. Delivered with a thermal study for all new builds and extensions is also required to ensure compliance with thermal efficiency regulations can be achieved and the appropriate certificate issued.

  process_title15: Planning application
  process_content15: Architectural plans, project brief, 3D images, certificates are all compiled in one file and attached to the application which will then be sent to the local authorities by post for approval. Depending on the project the approval process can take up to 3 months. This is the start of the build phase!

  process_title16: Detailed quotation
  process_content16: While the project sits with local authorities and is under review, all the construction tasks and quantities can now be listed and the quotation can be produced. Trades from our network are invited to bid  as well as a few local ones, meticulously selected according to their level of competencies, company financial health, past references and availability. Unless specified, standard equipment is included. The detailed quotation will include all elements of the build with no exception so that there is no surprise. All jobs are also detailed and translated into english for your ease.

  process_title17: Planning approval
  process_content17: Once all the divisions of the planning authorities have given their positive feedback on the project, the approval is given. You will therefore receive the exiting news by post.

  process_title18: Site board installation
  process_content18: Once the planning permission is obtained, the site board is installed.

  process_title19: Blueprints
  process_content19: Our engineers will then work on the blueprints of your project which will allow them to give clear instructions to the specialist trades. This includes the structural plans, plumbing plans, ventilations plans and electric plans. All of which are included within the build contract at no extra cost to avoid all assumptions and mistakes.

  process_title20: Material & equipment selection
  process_content20: Although already decided items and standard equipment are included within the detailed quotation, you can now decide once and for all on material and equipment. This process allows you to not delay the project while having more time to think and agree with your partner on the finishes. This, based on your tastes but also on the financial margin you have at that stage of the project to invest more money in the details that matter to you.

  process_title21: Price revision
  process_content21: As the materials and equipments are decided the detailed quotation is edited to include the price revision. Once you’re happy with everything the building works can begin.

  process_title22: Building contract signature
  process_content22: A detailed quote is not enough and a building project represents important financial implications. Therefore you must be protected through the appropriate building contract including the schedule of work and the schedule of payment. We carry the risk of the build for our clients and building works are therefore invoiced by Dreamstones so that your money is protected. Dreamstones contracts with all trades so that nothing can go wrong. Therefore, in order to book all trades and start ordering the necessary materials, the contract should be signed early enough so that no additional delays are occurred.


  process_title23: Site preparation
  process_content23: The health and safety plan and the waste management plan are set. The building warrant is obtained. Your site is also covered by our insurance for the entire build phase.

  process_title24: Site opening
  process_content24: |
                    On-site marking is in place. The site access is built. The skip is ordered.
                    Now, the work can begin!

  process_title25: Building works
  process_content25: All trades get the final version of the blueprints with clear instructions on how and when to proceed for their part of the work. All other plans must be deleted. The building works start with a first site meeting organised by the site manager where all trades are introduced to each other. The site manager ensures the good communication with all trades and the building site is managed with a focus on quality, time but also safety. You are constantly kept informed of the progress and communication with all stakeholders thanks to regular progress reports and site pictures. You can sit back and see the magic happen as your house is getting built.

  process_title26: Snagging resolution
  process_content26: All projects have details at the end which need to be addressed and solved so that your house is in tip top condition for you to move in. Our team ensures that all of them are fixed for the the last payment to be released. This way you stay in complete control of the end result. All certificates of compliance are also obtained and the local authorities are notified of the site completion.

  process_title27: Key handling
  process_content27: The site is cleaned, utilities set up and property tax are organised on your behalf for your ease. Building works are guaranteed for 10 years so no need to worry about costly unforeseen expenditure. If any problem arises out-with the warranty, our support team is also here for you and will react promptly to find the best solution.

  process_title28: Furnishing
  process_content28: Unless you have this sorted already, our team can assist you with moving in your furniture or ordering and installing new items. All you have to do is decide on what you want and enjoy your new French house with your family and friends.

  team_title: Meet the team
  team_p1: Samuel CASTELLO and Quentin KAISER are the proud founders of DREAMSTONES. Being both highly qualified and experienced from the home building industry, they noticed the difficulties friends and family members were facing in their construction project especially when dealing with several stakeholders (architects, engineers, local authorities, trades, etc.) and decided to solve this problem by creating DREAMSTONES in 2012 to offer a full service to design & build a bespoke home in Europe.
  team_p2: With the financial, time and stress implications that a building project can bring with it, we feel personally very involved and committed to help our clients with all aspects of the design & build and not just a part of it. So many people hesitate and are unsure about the best way to go about their house project. As a building project comprises a lot of aspects, not approaching it as a whole always end up in compromises and time wasting. We wanted to solve this problem by providing a single point of contact for a design & build project and created Dreamstones to include all specialities and trades. This way we could ensure the best communication of important information along the project and save the cost of having a lot of different stakeholders on a individual basis, which is what everybody was looking for. More and more people are now following the process we have developped and are satisified with both the ease and the end result. Our whole team work very hard to make this possible but the reward of creating our clients dream home is immense and not one is the same. Samuel CASTELLO
