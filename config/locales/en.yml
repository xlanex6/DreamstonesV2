## preparation ##


  process_title1: Project discussion
  process_content1: A successful house project starts with a good brief and a vision. We compile and review all the information available about your project (photos, cadastral plans, copy of local planning regulations, design inspirations, etc.) and then organise a project discussion. Either made in person or through a video call, this first discussion is essential to understand your project in all its aspects as well as your expectations.
  process_title2: Site inspection
  process_content2: Either for a new build or a renovation, a site inspection is mandatory to assess the existing and evaluate the future scope of work. It must consider all aspects of the plot/property (dimensions, condition, etc.). Other important factors are taken into account including the local authorities recommendation for planning.
  process_title3: Gross estimate
  process_content3: The gross estimate will allow you to have a clear understanding of the scope of work and the financial implications that go with it. This often enables the owners of a project to decide the parts in which they wish to invest money or not. As a result, a budget can be set and the design can be developed accordingly.


## design ##


  process_title7: Specifications listing
  process_content7: In order to ensure that your house will include all the necessary space, equipment and features to accommodate your taste and needs, the design of your house must start by a detailed listing of all specifications. A document lists it all and is ready for you to complete either on your own or with the help of our team so that nothing is missed.
  process_title8: Draft layout plans
  process_content8: As a house is, first of all, a combination of spaces, the draft layout plans is the puzzle game where the different options are identified. The excitement rises as decisions are being made. Most uncertainties disappear as you can start to imagine the logical link between all rooms.

  process_title9: Sketch of concept building
  process_content9: Although it is very tempting to start drawing prior to this stage and sometimes beneficial to get inspirations, this is the stage where the magic starts to take place and the house internal but also external shapes are designed. The look is therefore more concrete and changes can also be applied in order to achieve the desired style.

  process_title10: Planning pre-approval
  process_content10: Planning can be complicated when the project is not developed in accordance to the local regulations. This is why they must be considered from the preparation phase. Whilst the house has been designed in consideration of the planning rules, submission of the concept building for pre-approval is a must. It allows to progress efficiently to the architectural drawings with the peace of mind resulting from the positive feedback of local authorities. If any changes are required, it is the best time to do this so that no time is wasted and no additional delays are incurred.

  process_title11: 3D modelling
  process_content11: Drawings are essential to the design phase but the most up-to-date technology can now allow you to get a very realistic impression of your house. An accurate 3D model of your house at scale is therefore created for you to have a very clear idea of what it is going to look like and which materials would go well together. It’s like being in a video game of your own house and even the trades also like to see it during the build phase to complete the work in perfect accordance to the model.

  process_title12: Architectural plans
  process_content12: Once the proposed project has received a satisfactory feedback from the planning authorities and all details have been decided on the 3D, the architectural plans can now be drawn up. This includes the master plan, the layouts, the elevations and the sections, at scale and with all the necessary dimensions and details.

  process_title13: Technical studies
  process_content13: In order to apply for planning permission, a few mandatory technical studies must be carried out starting with the soil permeability study. A soil engineer will collect samples on site in specific locations on the plot and write his report. This will allow for the wastewater treatment study to be carried out and for the mandatory certificate to be delivered. A thermal study is also required for all new builds to ensure compliancy with thermal efficiency regulations.

  process_title14: Planning application
  process_content14: Architectural plans, project brief, 3D images, certificates are all compiled in one file and attached to the application which is then sent to the local authorities by post for approval. Depending on the project type, the approval process can take from 1 to 3 months. This is the start of the build phase!

  process_title16: Detailed quotation
  process_content16: While the project sits with local authorities and is under review, all the construction tasks and quantities can now be listed and the quotation can be produced. Trades from our network are invited to bid as well as some local ones, meticulously selected according to their level of competencies, company financial health, past references and availability. Unless specified, standard equipment is included. The detailed quotation will include all elements of the build with no exception so that there is no surprise. All jobs are also detailed and translated into english for your ease.

  process_title17: Planning approval
  process_content17: When all the divisions of the planning authorities have given their positive feedback on the project, the approval is given. You will therefore receive the exciting news by post. Once the planning permission is obtained, the site board can be installed.

  process_title18: Technical blueprints
  process_content18: Our team will then work on the technical blueprints of your project which will allow us to give clear instructions to the specialist trades. This includes the structural plans, plumbing plans, ventilations plans, electrical plans, etc.

  process_title19: Material & equipment selection
  process_content19: Although already decided items and standard equipment are included within the detailed quotation, you can now decide once and for all on material and equipment. Our team is here to advise you on the details that matter to you and provides you with the largest possible choice so that it matches your expectations. This includes your kitchen cabinets, surfaces, sink, tap and white goods, as well as your bathroom(s), floors, doors, etc.

  process_title20: Building contract
  process_content20: As the materials and equipments are decided the detailed quotation is edited to include the price revision. Your building contract including the schedule of work and the schedule of payment is drawn up and the work can begin.

  process_title21: Site opening
  process_content21: All trades get the final version of the technical blueprints with clear instructions on how and when to proceed for their part of the work. The building works start with a first site meeting organised by the site manager where all trades are introduced to each other. The health & safety plan and the waste management plan are set, the building warrant is obtained, on-site marking is in place, the site access is built and the skip is in place. Now, the work can begin!

  process_title22: Building works
  process_content22: The site manager ensures the good communication with all trades and lead the operations on site with a focus on quality, time but also safety. You are constantly kept informed of the progress and communication with all stakeholders thanks to our regular progress reports and site pictures. You can sit back and see the magic happen as your house is getting built.

  process_title23: Snagging resolution
  process_content23: Also we always aim for the best possible result, every project have details at the end which need to be addressed so that your house is in tip top condition for you to move in. Our team ensures that all of them are covered before the last payment is released. This way you stay in complete control of the end result. All certificates of compliance are also obtained and the local authorities are notified of the site completion.
